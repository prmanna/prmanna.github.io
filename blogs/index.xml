      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been long time, I was keep thinking to write blog. But, always getting delayed due to fear, whether I am good at writing, or people will like it or not, etc. Finally, I overcome this fear and started writing from new year, 2020.
Just to give little background about me, myself, Prasenjit Manna, working with networking industry as programmer, developer, architect, influencer since 2000. My area of interest is always routing, switching, manageability, optical, etc.</description>

Also, it should be readable and understandable by other developers. It should also follow few code principles. This is your professional responsibility that the code you write will be re-read by many other developers, who want to either understand or modify the code.</description>
