Is it primarily a survey, a novel theoretical contribution, an empirical application of an existing theory or technique, a critique, or something else? Go back and read the whole thing quickly, skipping equations, most figures and tables.</description>

      <description>Wisdom from Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack by Charlie Munger.&#xA;‚ÄúMimicking the herd invited regression to the mean.‚Äù If you do the same things as all the others, you cannot expect different results. Common plagues privately and professionally are status anxiety, social proof tendency, and the keeping-up-with-the-Joneses syndrome ‚Äì doing what we can to be like the rest. It is not until you stop doing this, and instead find a unique way for yourself, that you will see other results.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been leading and building sales orgs for almost 20 years and my advice is to walk up and hit the ball.&#xA;Sales is about people and it&amp;rsquo;s about problem solving. It is not about solutions or technology or chemicals or lines of code or artichokes.</description>

Never read passively. Annotate, model, think, and synthesize while you read, even when you‚Äôre reading what you conceive to be introductory stuff. That way, you will always aim towards understanding things at a resolution fine enough for you to be creative.</description>
