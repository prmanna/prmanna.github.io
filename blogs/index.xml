      <description>Charlie Muner once said:
You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.
If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out trying and soon find out that it’s hopeless—that other people blow right by you.</description>

      <description>A set of 10 rules as listed in Ed Boyden’s popular blog post in MIT Technology Review, Nov 2007.
Managing brain resources in an age of complexity.
  Synthesize new ideas constantly. Never read passively. Annotate, model, think, and synthesize while you read, even when you’re reading what you conceive to be introductory stuff. That way, you will always aim towards understanding things at a resolution fine enough for you to be creative.</description>

      <description>Charles Darwin’s 8 Steps to Steady-State Learning
 A life-long program of self-study Keeping a diary/journal Scribbling notes immediately Keeping “indexed portfolios” (notes/summaries of what you&amp;rsquo;ve read or heard) Testing beloved concepts – make a note, immediately, if you come across a thought or idea that is contrary to something you currently believe. Absorb it, study it and don&amp;rsquo;t let it go until you conclude that you need to change your mind or if the thought or ideas is wrong Learning lessons by heart Seeking to earn the approval of great men (dead or alive) The humility to seek not fame (as in, wisdom flows into the humble man like water flows into a depression)  Join my email list to get direct access to new blog posts.</description>

      <description>Entrepreneur Colin Dowling on sales, via HN:
  Sales is a lot like golf. You can make it so complicated as to be impossible or you can simply walk up and hit the ball. I&amp;rsquo;ve been leading and building sales orgs for almost 20 years and my advice is to walk up and hit the ball.
  Sales is about people and it&amp;rsquo;s about problem solving. It is not about solutions or technology or chemicals or lines of code or artichokes.</description>

Until recently, my friend Biplab asked me the questions:
&amp;ldquo;How do you feel at the end of a hard day? Do you feel satisfied, fulfilled, or disappointed? Are you productive?</description>

      <description>Table of contents  Why is this important? What do we achieve? Principles  A good code must satisfy few requirements: it must produce correct results, for which it is written. Also, it should be readable and understandable by other developers. It should also follow few code principles. This is your professional responsibility that the code you write will be re-read by many other developers, who want to either understand or modify the code.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been long time, I was keep thinking to write blog. But, always getting delayed due to fear, whether I am good at writing, or people will like it or not, etc. Finally, I overcome this fear and started writing from new year, 2020.
Just to give little background about me, myself, Prasenjit Manna, working with networking industry as programmer, developer, architect, influencer since 2000. My area of interest is always routing, switching, manageability, optical, etc.</description>
