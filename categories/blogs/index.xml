      <description>Productivity concept is always there in my mind, but never thought so deeply. Until recently, my friend Biplab asked me the questions:
&amp;ldquo;How do you feel at the end of a hard day? Do you feel satisfied, fulfilled, or disappointed? Are you productive?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;may be yes!&amp;quot;&amp;ndash;I said with a deep sigh.
In general, when I think about productivity, it comes to our mind about industrial productivity, the input vs output. This is there for ages.</description>

Also, it should be readable and understandable by other developers. It should also follow few code principles. This is your professional responsibility that the code you write will be re-read by many other developers, who want to either understand or modify the code.</description>
