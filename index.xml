      <title>Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions for Routing</title>

      <description>Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions Non-cryptographic hash functions take a string as input and compute an integer output. The desirable property of a hash function is that the outputs are evenly distributed across the domain of possible outputs, especially for inputs that are similar. Unlike a cryptographic hash function, these functions are not designed to withstand an effort by an attacker to find a collision. Cryptographic hash functions have this property, but are much slower: SHA-1 is on the order of 0.</description>

      <description>Over last 10 years, IPv6 standards have evolved significantly. It is important to understand the current status of these standards, as ongoing evolution—driven by various real-world deployments—has rendered some earlier standards obsolete. The following documents provide an overview of IPv6 and its current standardization status.&#xA;Primer - A collaborative IPv6 book by Nick Buraglio and Brian E.

      <description>A History of Network Switches 1990s: Layer 2 Switches Network switches (switches for short) are the evolution of network bridges whose behavior was defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the standard IEEE 802.1 to connect two or more Ethernet segments. Switch and switching are terms that do not exist in standards; they were introduced to indicate a multiport bridge.&#xA;Initially, switches were pure layer 2 devices that forwarded Ethernet frames without knowing their content and without modifying the frames, thus providing connectivity for the many layer 3 protocols deployed in those days.</description>

      <description>Summary:&#xA;Read the abstract (if provided)* Read the introduction. Read the conclusion. Skim the middle, looking at section titles, tables, figures, etc.—try to get a feel for the style and flow of the article. Is it methodological, conceptual, theoretical (verbal or mathematical), empirical, or something else? Is it primarily a survey, a novel theoretical contribution, an empirical application of an existing theory or technique, a critique, or something else? Go back and read the whole thing quickly, skipping equations, most figures and tables.</description>

      <description>In the last article, NETCONF vs RESTCONF I have explained the difference between netconf and restconf and their use-cases. Netconf has very rich functionality, whereas restconf has matching functionality. Restconf has opened the door for the framework with REST-based system and infrastructure.&#xA;The gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) protocol comes from the openconfig consortium, a group of network operators led by Google, with the following mission - &amp;ldquo;OpenConfig is an informal working group of network operators sharing the goal of moving our networks toward a more dynamic, programmable infrastructure by adopting software-defined networking principles such as declarative configuration and model-driven management and operations&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>NETCONF vs RESTCONF&#xA;NETCONF is a protocol that was developed to provide a standardized interface to Network Element(NE)/Device to retrieve and manipulate configuration data.&#xA;Till now, CLI is the standard interface to interact with NE. but this is mainly for human. On the other hand, the NETCONF is mainly used for network automation.&#xA;CLI normally defined for human in user friendly way.&#xA;Content Config, Oper Data Operations &amp;lt;get-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;edit-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;copy-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;delete-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;lock&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;unlock&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;close-session&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;kill-session&amp;gt; Messages &amp;lt;rpc&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;rpc-reply&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;notification&amp;gt; Secure Transport SSH, TLS RESTCONF is an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic interface for accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastore concepts defined in NETCONF.</description>

      <description>Network Programmability, which is preferred? SNMP or CLI or Yang Network programmability is directly linked to Software Defined Network (SDN). So, it is driven by real benefits like time and cost savings, reduction of human error, customization and innovation. The network programmability is now understood as a set of tools and best practices to deploy, manage and troubleshoot network device, but it&amp;rsquo;s way beyond that.&#xA;Network programmability is not new. From the screen scrapping, to bash and expect scripts.</description>

      <description>Wisdom from Poor Charlie’s Almanack by Charlie Munger.&#xA;“Mimicking the herd invited regression to the mean.” If you do the same things as all the others, you cannot expect different results. Common plagues privately and professionally are status anxiety, social proof tendency, and the keeping-up-with-the-Joneses syndrome – doing what we can to be like the rest. It is not until you stop doing this, and instead find a unique way for yourself, that you will see other results.</description>

And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.&#xA;If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out trying and soon find out that it’s hopeless—that other people blow right by you.</description>
