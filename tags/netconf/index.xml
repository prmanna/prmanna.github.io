      <description>NETCONF vs RESTCONF
NETCONF is a protocol that was developed to provide a standardized interface to Network Element(NE)/Device to retrieve and manipulate configuration data.
Till now, CLI is the standard interface to interact with NE. but this is mainly for human. On the other hand, the NETCONF is mainly used for network automation.
CLI normally defined for human in user friendly way.
   Content Config, Oper Data     Operations &amp;lt;get-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;edit-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;copy-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;delete-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;lock&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;unlock&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;close-session&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;kill-session&amp;gt;   Messages &amp;lt;rpc&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;rpc-reply&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;notification&amp;gt;   Secure Transport SSH, TLS    RESTCONF is an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic interface for accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastore concepts defined in NETCONF.</description>

      <description>In the last article, NETCONF vs RESTCONF I have explained the difference between netconf and restconf and their use-cases. Netconf has very rich functionality, whereas restconf has matching functionality. Restconf has opened the door for the framework with REST-based system and infrastructure.
The gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) protocol comes from the openconfig consortium, a group of network operators led by Google, with the following mission - &amp;ldquo;OpenConfig is an informal working group of network operators sharing the goal of moving our networks toward a more dynamic, programmable infrastructure by adopting software-defined networking principles such as declarative configuration and model-driven management and operations&amp;rdquo;.</description>
