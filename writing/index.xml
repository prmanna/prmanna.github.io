      <description>Traffic tromboning is a phenomena in data center traffic configuration or service chaining, while some service is bottleneck for rest of the flows. The service chaining can be created between leaves and spines using VXLAN and VRF way.
This is the article written by Mario Baldi and Silvano Gai originally posted in Traffic Tromboning Why, What, Where, How, and How Not
Why do we have traffic tromboning? Network and security services have traditionally been deployed in front of a group of end hosts that share some common function and are topologically close: e.</description>

      <description>A History of Network Switches 1990s: Layer 2 Switches Network switches (switches for short) are the evolution of network bridges whose behavior was defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in the standard IEEE 802.1 to connect two or more Ethernet segments. Switch and switching are terms that do not exist in standards; they were introduced to indicate a multiport bridge.
Initially, switches were pure layer 2 devices that forwarded Ethernet frames without knowing their content and without modifying the frames, thus providing connectivity for the many layer 3 protocols deployed in those days.</description>

      <description>In the last article, NETCONF vs RESTCONF I have explained the difference between netconf and restconf and their use-cases. Netconf has very rich functionality, whereas restconf has matching functionality. Restconf has opened the door for the framework with REST-based system and infrastructure.
The gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) protocol comes from the openconfig consortium, a group of network operators led by Google, with the following mission - &amp;ldquo;OpenConfig is an informal working group of network operators sharing the goal of moving our networks toward a more dynamic, programmable infrastructure by adopting software-defined networking principles such as declarative configuration and model-driven management and operations&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>NETCONF vs RESTCONF
NETCONF is a protocol that was developed to provide a standardized interface to Network Element(NE)/Device to retrieve and manipulate configuration data.
Till now, CLI is the standard interface to interact with NE. but this is mainly for human. On the other hand, the NETCONF is mainly used for network automation.
CLI normally defined for human in user friendly way.
   Content Config, Oper Data     Operations &amp;lt;get-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;edit-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;copy-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;delete-config&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;lock&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;unlock&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;close-session&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;kill-session&amp;gt;   Messages &amp;lt;rpc&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;rpc-reply&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;notification&amp;gt;   Secure Transport SSH, TLS    RESTCONF is an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic interface for accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastore concepts defined in NETCONF.</description>

      <description>What is APIs?
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are module: they take inputs and give you predictable outputs.   At its core, an API is a bunch of code that takes an input and gives you an output
  Sometimes, companies will make parts of their APIs publicly available, like github, Twitter or Google Maps
  In modern era, your favourite applications are collection of APIs.
  In WWW, the programmatic service is provided by the APIs.</description>

      <description>Network Programmability, which is preferred? SNMP or CLI or Yang Network programmability is directly linked to Software Defined Network (SDN). So, it is driven by real benefits like time and cost savings, reduction of human error, customization and innovation. The network programmability is now understood as a set of tools and best practices to deploy, manage and troubleshoot network device, but it&amp;rsquo;s way beyond that.
Network programmability is not new. From the screen scrapping, to bash and expect scripts.</description>
