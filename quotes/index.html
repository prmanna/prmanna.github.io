<p>&ldquo;The very word &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.&rdquo; – John F. Kennedy</p>

<p>&ldquo;The qualities that made for success in a fighter-pilot seemed to be just those sturdy qualities that made for success in other professions; observation, initiative, determination, courage, including the courage to run away.

<li>
<p>&ldquo;Everything about it was visibly mis-shapen, corrupt, crawling, verminous; for a time I could not bear to look at it, and passed with averted eyes; recovering from this weakness, I forced myself to look, and to face day by day the question: a thing so obviously, so incontrovertibly, so indefensibly bad, why had Scott done it?&rdquo; – R. G. Collingwood on the Albert Memorial</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we chose always to be wise we should rarely need to be virtuous. But inclinations which we could easily overcome irresistibly attract us. We give in to slight temptations and minimize the danger. We fall insensibly into dangerous situations, from which we could easily have safeguarded ourselves, but from which we cannot withdraw without heroic efforts which appal us. So finally, as we tumble into the abyss, we ask God why he has made us so feeble. But, in spite of ourselves, He replies through our consciences: &lsquo;I have made you too feeble to climb out of the pit, because I made you strong enough not to fall in.'&rdquo; – Rousseau, Confessions, Cohen trans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then in 1888 came the publication of Denton&rsquo;s history of England in the fifteenth century. This was a masterpiece of egregious perversity, depicting the later Middle Ages as a culminating period of ruinous taxation, iniquitous labour laws, demoralizing pestilences, and lavish dissipation of national resources upon violent and embittered domestic feuds and futile and indecisive foreign wars. The credulity of even the most undiscriminating reader was taxed to a degree by a portrayal in which horror succeeded upon cataclysm, in a thickening atmosphere of crime and terror, want, degradation, and wretchedness.&rdquo; – A. R. Bridbury</p>
