<p>&ldquo;The very word &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.

This was a masterpiece of egregious perversity, depicting the later Middle Ages as a culminating period of ruinous taxation, iniquitous labour laws, demoralizing pestilences, and lavish dissipation of national resources upon violent and embittered domestic feuds and futile and indecisive foreign wars.
